          <p>Hi, I'm Liz!</p>
          <p>
            I've got a background in marketing, project management, entrepreneurship, and operations. I've been building
            Wordpress websites for years, and in 2023 I completed Lighthouse Labs' Web Development Bootcamp. 
            This site showcases some of my work. If you're interested in working with me,
            please reach out to me via <a href="mailto:lizfosdick@gmail.com">email</a> or on
             <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lizfosdick/">Linkedin</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
             Thanks for visiting!

        <p>A local plumbing and heating company hired me to build <a href="https://hometown-h2o.com/">
          a website for their business</a> and assist with their overall marketing. I built the site in Wordpress  
          using OceanWP and Stackable Gutenberg Blocks. I wrote all content on the site, with a focus on optimizing for 
          SEO while also incorporating the voice of the business owner.

          <p>I previously worked for <a href="https://orbitapps.com/">Orbit Apps</a>, a Shopify app company, and while there I built the company's website 
           in Wordpress using Divi. I wrote the vast majority of the content on the site.
            <em>Some small formatting changes have been made since I left but overall the site very much reflects my work.</em>

          <p>Of course, I built this site, too! I used HTML and CSS, and it's hosted through Github. 
            In my career I've mostly worked with content management systems, so it's a treat to now be able to build something totally on my own.
            This is the first site I've created from scratch since my Geocities days.

          <p>As mentioned above, I wrote all the content on <a href="https://hometown-h2o.com/">Hometown Plumbing & Heating's website.</a></p>
          <p><strong>Orbit Apps</strong></p>
          <p>I wrote the majority of the content on the company website, including these highlights:</p>
          <ul class="li">
            <li><a href="https://orbitapps.com/how-to-sell-wholesale-on-shopify/">How to Sell Wholesale on Shopify,</a> an overview of merchants' options for selling wholesale on Shopify.</li>
            <li><a href="https://orbitapps.com/wholesale-club-101/">Wholesale Club 101,</a> a series of articles designed to help merchants understand aspects of wholesale sales and how they functioned in the company's app.</li>
            <li><a href="https://orbitapps.com/how-to-pick-an-offer-in-ultimate-special-offers/">How to Pick an Offer in Ultimate Special Offers,</a> a guide for merchants to help determine what kinds of sales and promotions will work best for their businesses.</li>

          <p>I did part time work for several years for this premium apron business based out of Vancouver (and, full disclosure, owned by my brother).
          I primarily wrote short blog posts profiling brand ambassadors, but I did enjoy putting together this article: <a href="https://searchandrescuedenim.com/blogs/blog/80-questions-to-improve-your-brand">80+ Questions to Improve Your Brand</a>.</p>

      <p><a href="https://try-pods-fly.fly.dev/">Try-Pods</a> was my final project for the Lighthouse Labs Web Development Bootcamp.
        I teamed up with <a href="https://github.com/rowanmack">Rowan McKenzie</a> and <a href="https://bootonk.github.io/personal-portfolio/">Kate Booton</a> to build an app where users can share and discover podcasts.
        It's built with React and Ruby on Rails.

        <p>My <a href="https://github.com/lizfosdick/profit-and-margin-calc">profit and margin calculator</a> is a simple JavaScript command line app that I use for my Etsy businesses.
          It's incredibly customized and wouldn't be useful to anyone else, but for my purposes it works very well!
          It eliminates the need for spreadsheets and allows me to quickly calculate profit and margin when
          inventory costs, shipping costs, merchant fees, or prices change.

          It gave me an opportunity to work with TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS for the first time. I've made a few small custom tweaks to the project
          and will continue to do so to practice my React skills.

        can be booked, edited, and cancelled. It uses React, Webpack, Babel, Axios, and 
        WebSockets. The app was tested with Storybook, Jest, and Cypress.
